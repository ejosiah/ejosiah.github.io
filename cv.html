                    <p>I Was responsible for applications which were used to integrate internal data with 3rd party solution providers, These applications where built using akka stream
                     which where connected to kafka brokers on the upstream to receive events triggered by customer actions. Once events are consumed they are run through several flows
                    where they are transformed and enriched before they are sent to our 3rd party solution providers. Below is some of the activities I was involved in:

                                The previous maintainers used sbt & helm charts for building and deployment the apps which was non-standard within Sky, so my first task was to migrate away
                                from this to gradle and using Sky's gradle plugin for kubernetes deployment. I implemented several gradle plugins in the process.

                                collected metrics from the applications and installed Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, I also implemented gradle plugins
                                for publishing app specific dashboards to Grafana

                        I was the team lead on the payments system for HMRC, this system for responsible for collecting and processing tax payments from our customers, my responsibilities included:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Led the team using extreme programing practices include pair programing, test driven design, frequent releases and short development cycles</li>
                            <li>Came up with the strategy and led the team for transitioning to a new payment provider</li>
                            <li>
                                January 31 is aways a big day for HMRC as Self Assessment tax is collected, consolidation happens the next day, the previous consolidation system could only handle 200K records before it came to a halt.
                                I was tasked with rewriting and optimizing the consolidation process. so I reversed engineered the system and determined that it was implemented using a number microservices and loading up all the records
                                into memory, so the 3 main issues I was able to glean was that 1.) integration points as a result of using microservices are prone to high latency,
                                2.) the Garbage collector is always active due to high memory usage (this is also a latency issue) and 3.) The consolidation process is a batch process and there is no need to implement it using microservices.
                                With this information in hand I re-implemented the consolidation system as a single service using akka-streams and batch queries to the database, which resulted in being able to process a million records in under 3 minutes
                            </li>

                            <li>The gateway uses Hazelcast for high speed messaging, mission critical data is pre-loaded into RAM at start up to avoid blocking on IO during reads, IO operations on user request threads are avoided as much as possible and are performed on a dedicated IO thread. Log4j2 was used to enable heavy logging but still preserve the application’s responsiveness; this is possible because Log4j2 uses asynchronous logging and the LMAX disruptor for none blocking concurrency</li>
                            <li>Designed and implemented the messaging system which was based on the Enterprise integration patterns, Hazelcast was used as the conduit for transferring messages around the cluster (Although I did use GridGain at first but quickly reverted to Hazelcast as GrainGain was slightly more complex and time did not allow for its continued use</li>
                            <li>Designed and implemented the Bitcoin client which uses JSON-RPC to connect to a bitcoind daemon which in turn connects to the Bitcoin p2p network</li>

                    <p>Moved to the Games Platform team which was developing Gamesys’s next generation gaming platform to help implement and mentor team members on the proper use of Agile methodologies  
                        <ol>>
                            <li>Took over the role of SCRUM Master for 2 iterations, introduced sprint retrospectives, showed the team the proper use of daily scrum meeting and introduced a product owner to the project</li>
                            <li>Introduced view objects to the project as the team was previously using ACLs between every tier of the project architecture which lead to a proliferation of DTLs.</li>
                            <li>I was also responsible for the Architecture for cross cutting concerns (exception handling, logging, etc.); which was implemented using Spring AOP</li>
                            <li>As the project was already in progress before I joined the team; the current architecture used a scheduling framework (Quarts) for scheduling subsequent games. As a result of the decision to use scheduling, overlapping games were crippling the system and the team’s current fix was to use time offsets which still did not fix the problem. I introduced the team to the concept of using coordinators instead of scheduling; which takes the responsibility of scheduling subsequent games away from the scheduler and removes overlaps as subsequent games only start after the previous game was finished. Hazelcast was used for implementation as it comes pre-packaged with distributed locking features</li>
