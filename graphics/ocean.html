                    <p>The physical model is to describe the surfacce in terms of the motion of individual points on the surface. 
                        To a good approximation, points on the surface go through a circular motion as a wave passes by. If a point
                        on the undisturbed surface is labelled ${\mathbf{x_0} = (x_0, y_0)}$ and the undistured height is ${y_0 = 0}$, 
                        then as a singl wave with amplitude A passes by the point on the surface is displaced at time t to

                        In these expressions, the vector ${\mathbf{k}}$, called the wavevector, is a horizontal vector that points in The direction of travel of the wave,
                        and has magnitude ${k}$ related to the length of athe wave ${(\lambda)}$ by

                        Gerstner waves can be generalized to a more complex profile by summing a set of sin waves. One picks a set of wavevectors ${\mathbf{k_i}}$
                        , amplitudes ${A_i}$, frequencies ${\omega{_i}}$ and phase ${\phi{_i}}$, for ${i = 1,...,N}$ to get the expression

                    <h3>4.2 Animating Waves: The Dispersion Relation</h3>
                    <p>The animated behavior of Gerstner waves is determined by the set of frquencies ${\omega{_i}}$ chosen for each component.
                        For water waves, there is a well-known relationship between these frequencies and the magnitude of their corresponding 
                        wavevectors ${\mathbf{k}_i}$. In deep water, where the bottom may be ignore, that relationship is 
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">
                        ${\omega^2(k) = gk}$ <span class="inline">(31)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The parameter ${g}$ is the gravitational constant, nominally ${9.8m/sec^2}$. This dispersion relationship holds for Gerstner waves,
                        and also for FFT-based waves. There are several conditions in which the dispersion relationship is modified. When bottom is relatively shallow
                        compared to the length of the waves, the bottom has a retarding effect on the waves. For a bottom depth ${D}$ below the mean water level,
                        the dispersion relation is
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">
                        ${\omega^2(k) = gk\tanh(kD)}$ <span class="inline">(32)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second situation which modifies the dispersion relation is surface tension. Very small waves, with a wavelength of about 1 cm or less, have an additional term
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">${\omega^2(k) = gk(1 + k^2L^2)}$ <span class="inline">(33)</span></p>
                    <p>and the parameter ${L}$ has units of length. Its magnitude is the scale for the surface tension to have effect.</p>
                    <p>
                        Using these dispersion relationships, it is very difficult to create a sequence of frames of water surface which work for a continuous loop
                        In order to have the sequence repeat after a certain amout of time ${T} for example, it is necessary that all frequencies be multiples of the basic frequency
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">${\omega_0 } \equiv \frac{2 \pi}{T}$  <span class="inline">(34)</span></p>
                    <p>
                        However, when the wavevector ${\mathbf{k}}$ are distributed on a regular lattice, it is impossible t arrange the dispersion-generated frequencies to also be
                        on a uniform latticewith spacing ${\omega_o}$.
                        The solution to that is to not use the dispersion frequencies, but instead a set that is close to them For a given wavenumber ${k}$, we use the frequency

                    <p>
                        The FFT based representation of a wave height field expresses the wave height ${h(\mathbf{x}, t)}$ at the horizontal position ${\mathbf{x} = (x, z)}$ as the sum 
                        of sinusoids with complex, time dependent amplitudes:
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">
                        ${h(\mathbf{x}, t) = \sum{_k} \tilde{h}(\mathbf{k}, t) \exp{(i\mathbf{k \cdot x})}}$ <span class="inline">(36)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        where ${t}$ is the time and ${\mathbf{k}}$ is a two-dimensional vector with components ${k = (k_x, k_z)}$, ${k_x = 2 \pi n / L_x, k_z = 2 \pi m / L_z}$ and 
                        ${n}$ and ${m}$ are integers with bounds ${-N/2 \leq n \leq N/2 }$ and ${-M/2 \leq m \leq M/2 }$. The fft process generates the height field at discrete points 
                        ${\mathbf{x} = (n L_x/N, m L_z /M)}$.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The height amplitude Fourier components, ${\tilde{h} (\mathbf{k}, t)}$, determine the structure of the surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slope vector can be obtained by using more ffts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="block-formula">
                        ${ \epsilon (\mathbf{x}, t) = \Delta h(\mathbf{x}, t) = \sum_k i \mathbf{k} \tilde{h}(\mathbf{k}, t) \exp(i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}) }$ <span class="inline">(37)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of this fft representation, the finite difference approach would replace the term ${i \mathbf{k}}$ with terms proportional to

                        Statistical analysis of a number of wave-buoy, photographic and radar measurements of the ocean surface demonstrates that the wave height amplitudes ${\tilde{h} (\mathbf{k}, t)}$
                        are nearly Statistically stationary, independent, gaussian fluctuations with a spatial spectrum denoted by

                        A useful model for wind-driven waves larger than capillary waves in a fully developed sea is the <i>phillips</i> spectrum

                    <p class="block-formula">

                        where ${L = V^2 / g}$ is the largest possible waves arising from a continuous wind of speed ${V}$, ${g}$ is the gravitational constant and ${\hat{ \omega }}$ is the direction of the wind.
                        The cosine term ${ \vert \mathbf{ \hat{k} } \cdot \hat{ \omega } \vert{^2}}$ in the Phillips spectrum eliminates waves that move perperndicular to the wind direction.
                        This model, while relatively simple, has poor convergence properties at high values of the wavenumber ${ \vert \mathbf{k} \vert }$. A simple fix is to suppress waves smaller than a small

                        Realization of water wave height fields are created from the principles elaborated up to this point: gaussian random numbers with spatial spectra of a prescribed form. 
                        This is most efficiently accomplished directly in the fourier domain. The fourier amplitudes of a wave height field can be produced as
